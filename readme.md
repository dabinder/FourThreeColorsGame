# Quad Row

This was a coding experiment I put together based on a board game design my dad and I came up with while passing the time on the Trans-Siberian Railway.

Loosely based on Go, it instead involves three colors, with each player receiving the same total number of pieces but an unequal number of each color.

The application is written in WPF, targeting Visual Studio 2019, but can be compiled from Visual Studio 2010 and up.

## Gameplay

Players take turns placing pieces on the board. The game is won when a player places a fourth piece in a row of a particular color.
